# Snofyre [Unmaintained]

## Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/snofyre 

This is an automated export of the NHS sponsored Snofyre project - an unmaintained API for SNOMED CT. This project is left here as a record of the work that was done
in 2008-2011 in NHS UK, to demonstrate analytics on SNOMED CT coded electronic health records.

#### Overview

The prototype application that you see in the video on this page was created to demonstrate querying of SNOMED CT encoded clinical data. It was created using Snofyre.

Snofyre is an open source, service oriented API for creating SNOMED CT enabled applications in Java. It provides a number of SNOMED CT related services out of the box. These services can be used:
  - as a starter for understanding how to add SNOMED CT functionality to an application.
  - to rapidly prototype a SNOMED CT enabled application.
Snofyre API aims to
  - reduce the 'ramp up' time needed to understand
and embed SNOMED CT functionality in an application.

Snofyre uses a large number of other open source application frameworks like OSGi, Hibernate, Spring, Lucene etc which many developers will be familiar with. Snofyre does not come with any warranty. Please refer to appropriate section of the license.
